S: 1 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA (DREAM WORLD) – CRYSTAL HALL – DAY 1
N: DIRECT PICKUP FROM Episode 116 “The Worthy Dreamer.” OPEN ON
C: IZZIE, animated. 1 IZZIE 1
D: Think about it. Luna wouldn’t hide the story of how to defeat the Nightmare King in a book! This is the Dream World, people.
N: Our team -- MR. OZ, ALBERT, MATEO, Z BLOB, ZOEY, LOGAN, COOPER, PHIL, ZIAN, and the DREAMLINGS -- considers this.
C: 2 ALBERT 2
D: Point taken, Isabel. But if the story isn’t in a book, where is it?
C: 3 IZZIE 3
D: Right there.
N: With a sweep of her arm, Izzie gestures upwards to the gorgeous, impressionistic STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS above them. Sunlight streams in, refracted through the colorful glass.
C: 4 LOGAN 4
D: Um, what am I missing?
C: 5 COOPER 5
D: Beats me.
E: shrugs
N: ANGLE ON Mateo, staring at the windows, thoughtfully. From his POV, we see... each window is comprised of different- sized PANELS (like a MANGA COMIC). Mateo suddenly grins.
C: 6 MATEO 6
D: It’s like Bunchu and the Attack of the Killer Goo!
C: 7 IZZIE 7
D: Yep. Volume 23.
C: 8 MATEO 8
D: Genius, sis!
C: 9 IZZIE 9
D: I know.
E: with a cocky grin
N: Mateo rolls his eyes but tousles his sister’s hair lovingly. The others look on, confused. LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 2.
C: 10 ZOEY 10
D: One of you gonna tell us what’s up?
C: 11 IZZIE 11
D: Our favorite Bunchu Bunny manga is a flip book. When you turn the pages, the images animate.
C: 12 ZOEY 12
D: And that’s relevant because...?
C: 13 MATEO 13
D: What if the windows are sorta the same? We don’t need to read Luna’s story, we need to watch it!
N: Our team looks doubtful, but Mr. Oz and Albert perk up.
C: 14 MR. OZ 14
D: I could see Luna obscuring the true nature of the story to protect it from the Nightmare King...
C: 15 ALBERT 15
D: And tying it to Castle Nocturnia so only a Dreamchaser could find it.
C: 16 COOPER 16
D: Cool. So, how do we decipher a story set in some windows?
C: 17 MATEO 17
D: No idea.
E: shrugs
N: Everyone groans, except Logan, puzzling over one window.
C: 18 LOGAN 18
D: Hey Mr. Oz. Who’s that?
N: He points to the one decipherable image in the FIRST STAINED- GLASS WINDOW: It’s MIGO, a sweet and adorable DREAM CREATURE.
C: 19 MR. OZ 19
D: That is Luna’s best friend, Migo. From the moment she dreamcrafted Migo, the two were inseparable.
N: Seeing the similarities between the Luna/Migo bond and their own friendship, Mateo and Z Blob exchange a glance.
C: 20 ALBERT 20
D: Sadly, when Luna disappeared, Migo did too.
N: LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 3.
C: 21 MATEO 21
D: I bet they’re together.
N: Z Blob solemnly jiggles in agreement. Suddenly-- BOOM! Loud, ominous THUNDER echoes around the room. For a beat, everyone freezes in fear.
C: 22 COOPER 22
D: Please tell me that wasn’t...
E: afraid
N: Zoey hops astride Zian and flaps into the air. She stares out of the stained-glass windows. REVERSE to reveal... a NIGHTMARE STORM! Black, billowing clouds fill the sky. Zian touches back down.
C: 23 ZOEY 23
D: Yeah, it’s a Nightmare Storm. And it’s approaching fast.
C: 24 PHIL 24
D: If it reaches us, it will corrupt the Castle!
E: ashen-faced
N: Our team instinctively huddles closer together.
C: 25 ALBERT 25
D: We hid our tracks. How’d this happen?
N: Teo can’t help it, he sneaks a look at Logan.
C: 26 LOGAN 26
D: Hey, don’t blame me! I didn’t give away our location!
N: On cue, the EYE TRACKER on Logan’s HAT BLINKS. Everyone gapes. Logan slumps, deflated.
C: 27 LOGAN 27
D: I did, didn’t I?
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone nods as the NIGHT HUNTER’S smug visage swirls into view within the eye shape on Logan’s hat.
C: 28 NIGHT HUNTER 28
D: Very astute, Logan. Only a brainless Dreamchaser would fall for such an obvious ploy...
N: The Night Hunter winks out. LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 4.
C: 29 IZZIE 29
D: I guess you could say he’s had his eye on you for quite some time...
N: Logan rips the hat from his head angrily, unsure what to do with it. Z Blob grabs the hat and swallows it! [Note: It dissolves to GREEN GOO as it hits his belly.]
C: 30 MR. OZ 30
D: Well, that’s one way to destroy a bugged hat.
N: Clocking the glum, frightened faces of our team, Mateo steps forward.
C: 31 MATEO 31
D: What’s everyone so upset about? This can work to our advantage!
C: 32 COOPER 32
E: unsure
C: I don’t know, Teo... 33 MATEO 33
D: No, this is good. If you guys can keep the Nightmare Storm at bay, I can decode Luna’s story. Then we can all defeat the Nightmare King together.
C: 34 ZOEY 34
D: If the Nightmare King’s itching for a fight, he came to the right place.
E: eyes narrowed
C: 35 IZZIE 35
D: Dang Zoey, you’re scary when you’re pissed.
E: impressed
N: Phil clears his throat and steps forward.
C: 36 PHIL 36
D: I may be able to help as well. You see, in 1577, Dream Keeper Shin not only installed indoor plumbing, he had the foresight to--
C: 37 ZOEY 37
D: Phil! Weapons? Yes? Or no?
N: LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 5.
C: 38 PHIL 38
D: What would you say if I told you Castle Nocturnia has a powerful light cannon?
N: Logan fist-pumps.
C: 39 LOGAN 39
D: I’d say hells yeahhh!
C: 40 MR. OZ 40
D: Dreamlings, find a place to hide. Cooper, you and I will assist Mateo. Everyone else, with Phil.
N: As the Dreamlings scurry off and Izzie, Albert, Zoey, Logan and Phil race away, CUT TO:
S: 2 EXT. SHARKYFACE AIRSHIP - DAY 2
N: Hidden within the Nightmare Storm, the MR. SHARKYFACE AIRSHIP flies towards the Castle. The NIGHTMARE KING stands eerily still as NIGHTLINGS, including SUSAN, SNEAK, and SNIVEL, race to and fro aboard the airship. The Night Hunter slinks up alongside the Nightmare King.
C: 41 NIGHT HUNTER 41
D: We’re almost in range, your Scariness.
N: The Nightmare King smiles malevolently.
C: 42 NIGHTMARE KING 42
D: Today we show the Dreamchasers what the Dark Army can do.
N: The Nightlings let out an unholy CHEER and race to take up positions. Some notch BOWS with ARROWS; others load CANNONS. Linger on Sneak looking less than gung-ho as we CUT TO:
S: 3 EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA (DREAM WORLD) – RAMPART – DAY 3
N: Phil, Izzie, Albert, Logan, Zoey, and Zian spill out onto the Castle’s rampart, and stare in horror at the truly terrifying sight of the encroaching Nightmare Storm.
C: 43 ALBERT 43
D: We have to stop the storm before it can corrupt the castle.
N: LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 6.
C: 44 IZZIE 44
D: Where’s that light cannon, big guy?
N: With a flourish, Phil whips a sheet off the LIGHT CANNON. (Retro-futuristic in style.) Zoey whistles, impressed.
C: 45 ZOEY 45
D: Score one for Dream Keeper Shin.
N: But when Phil pulls on the cannon’s lever to fire the cannon... it won’t budge!
C: 46 PHIL 46
D: It’s stuck!
N: Our team stares at the Nightmare Storm, rolling closer.
C: 47 ALBERT 47
D: We need to hurry!
N: Albert joins Phil and together, they try to tug on the lever. But try as they might, it doesn’t move an inch.
C: 48 IZZIE 48
D: Brace yourselves!
N: Izzie pulls out her hourglass and dreamcrafts her HAMMER. She swings it over her head... BOOSH! She brings the hammer down on the lever, which slams down and fires the cannon! BAWOOSH! Everyone momentarily shields their eyes as a blinding BLAST OF LIGHT blazes forth! ANGLE ON our team as they watch the continuous beam of light streak through the sky...
C: 49 LOGAN 49
D: C’mon, please work...
N: FATHOOM! The light beam SLAMs into the Nightmare Storm, freezing it in place! Phil and Albert high-five.
C: 50 ZOEY/IZZIE/LOGAN 50
D: Yes! / Direct hit! / Boo-yah!
N: OFF our heroes celebrating this success, we CUT TO:
S: 4 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – CRYSTAL HALL – CONTINUOUS 4
N: ON Z Blob moving one of the wall’s crystal tiles back and forth. LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 7. As the light streaming through the windows hits the tile, it reflects into Mateo’s eyes. He looks up, intrigued, but his attention is drawn by a frustrated SIGH from Cooper.
C: 51 COOPER 51
D: Why didn’t Luna leave us some freaking instructions?!
C: 52 MR. OZ 52
D: What do you do when you’re building something and the instructions are missing?
C: 53 COOPER 53
D: Look online to see if anyone’s posted ‘em.
C: 54 MR. OZ 54
D: But surely you must trust your instincts.
C: 55 COOPER 55
D: No seriously, Mr. Oz. They have everything online.
E: doubling-down
C: 56 MR. OZ 56
D: I’m not sure this would be there.
E: deadpan
C: 57 COOPER 57
D: Which is why it’s totally impossible without instructions!
E: with a groan
N: Mr. Oz looks like he’s going to argue but Teo interjects.
C: 58 MATEO 58
D: C’mon, Coop. Nothing’s impossible. As long as we do it together. We can do this. You did figure out how to unlock Luna’s Hourglass, after all.
E: off Coop’s dubious look
N: Cooper suddenly straightens, struck by a thought.
C: 59 COOPER 59
D: Wait! The Hourglass!
N: Oz, Teo and Z Blob exchange a confused glance as Cooper bends down to examine the floor. He searches around until... LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 8.
C: 60 COOPER 60
D: A-ha! I knew there was a reason that pattern felt familiar!
E: CONT'D
N: Cooper picks up Luna’s Hourglass and holds it above a TILE decorated with the same designs: FULL MOON, SUN, CRESCENT MOON, etc. He presses down on the middle of the tile and -- THWUNK! The tile FLIPS OVER to reveal... a beautiful, crystal PEDESTAL! Oz and Teo let out a startled GASP as Cooper picks slots Luna’s Hourglass into an HOURGLASS shaped INDENTATION on the pedestal. Nothing happens.
C: 61 COOPER 61
D: Luna’s Hourglass must be the key! It’s unlocked the rest of the Castle’s secrets so far.
E: CONT'D
N: Mateo looks thoughtfully from the light pouring through the windows to the Hourglass atop the pedestal and back.
C: 62 MATEO 62
D: What if there were a way to direct the light from the stained-glass windows through the Hourglass?
C: 63 MR. OZ/COOPER 63
D: Huh? / Whaddaya mean?
C: 64 MATEO 64
D: Show ‘em, Z.
N: Z Blob races over to move the tile he was playing with earlier back and forth. As it moves, it reflects the light shining through the stained-glass windows in different directions. (Think bouncing light off reflective shields to light the tomb in The Mummy). Cooper grins.
C: 65 COOPER 65
D: Who needs instructions when they’ve got us?
N: Coop and Mateo high-five; it feels like old times.
C: 66 MR. OZ 66
D: Excellent thinking, you two! Let’s get these tiles into position.
N: Mateo, Z Blob, Cooper, and Oz race around positioning the crystal tiles so that the light flowing through the FIRST STAINED-GLASS WINDOW bounces off different tiles until... it pierces Luna’s Hourglass! Suddenly... LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 9. WHOOSH! A translucent PEGASUS materializes and gallops straight for Cooper! He flinches, frozen in place and WHOOSH! The Pegasus passes right through him!
C: 67 MATEO 67
D: It’s a hologram.
E: awed
N: (Note: The sunlight streaming through the stained-glass windows is reflected off the crystal tiles and through the Hourglass thus creating a HOLOGRAM style projection that could look real or have a sepia tone to give it an aged feel. As the hologram plays, Oz, Mateo, and Cooper will narrate/connect the dots for our audience.) Oz, Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper watch transfixed as a translucent LUNA materializes. She looks lonely.
C: 68 MR. OZ 68
D: Luna... She looks so lonely.
N: In the hologram, Luna dreamcrafts MIGO. She envelopes the sweet DREAM CREATURE in a hug. Together, Luna and Migo are happy. They play on the swings, they visit Dream Realms, they read, they share an ICE CREAM SUNDAE.
C: 69 MATEO 69
D: I’m glad she dreamcrafted Migo.
N: Mateo smiles down at Z Blob –- the parallels between the two relationships apparent.
C: 70 MR. OZ 70
D: I wonder why Luna included this...
E: thoughtful
N: As if in answer to his question, Oz, Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper are suddenly surprised to see Migo gesticulate angrily at Luna when she tries to leave him. He wants her to stay.
C: 71 COOPER 71
D: Why’s he so upset?
N: In the hologram, Luna tries to placate Migo but he’s inconsolable. Her face fills with regret.
C: 72 MATEO 72
D: He wanted all of Luna’s attention.
N: Luna hugs Migo goodbye and he immediately throws a tantrum, screaming and pounding the floor. LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 10.
C: 73 MR. OZ 73
D: I think Migo grew resentful of Luna’s responsibilities as Dream Keeper and her ability to go to the Waking World.
C: 74 COOPER 74
D: What a baby. She couldn’t help that she had to leave for a little bit.
N: The hologram changes again -- this time, Migo waits until Luna falls asleep. Then he picks up her Hourglass and tries to dreamcraft... but nothing happens.
C: 75 MATEO 75
D: He’s trying to dreamcraft...
E: surprised
N: In the hologram, Migo is frustrated by his inability to dreamcraft. He throws plates and cups at the wall, SMASHING them. He ROARS, enraged! Z Blob grabs Mateo’s hand as if to say –- that wouldn’t happen to us. In the hologram, Luna catches Migo YELLING at Dreamlings, scaring them. Luna scolds Migo and he sulks petulantly.
C: 76 MR. OZ 76
D: His frustrations and fears are corrupting him.
N: DARK SMOKE swirls within the hologram, making it feel ominous and unsettling. When the smoke clears, Luna turns fitfully in her sleep. Oz, Mateo, Z Blob and Cooper watch horrified as Migo invades Luna’s dream as a nightmare! 77 MR. OZ (CONT'D) 77 (shocked) W-w-whaa-- Luna wakes up, frightened to see Migo elongate and transform into... the Nightmare King! Oz, Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper gasp, thunderstruck.
C: 78 MATEO 78
D: Luna created the Nightmare King.
E: astonished
N: OFF our heroes’ shock, CUT TO: LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 11.
S: 5 EXT. SHARKYFACE AIRSHIP - DAY 5
N: The Nightmare King, his eyes narrowed in anger at the steady beam of light holding the Nightmare Storm at bay. The Night Hunter lowers his CROSSBOW, approaches warily.
C: 79 NIGHT HUNTER 79
D: I’m sorry, your Ghastliness. That light cannon is just too strong.
C: 80 NIGHTMARE KING 80
D: We’ll see about that...
N: The Nightmare King strides to the bow of the ship and WHISTLES LOUDLY. A beat. And then... TWO NIGHT TERRORS fly out of the fog to hover by the ship. 81 NIGHTMARE KING (CONT'D) 81 Destroy the cannon, my lovelies. The Night Terrors SHRIEK with glee and disappear into the billowing clouds of the Nightmare Storm.
C: 82 NIGHT HUNTER 82
D: And if any Dream Chasers get hurt in the process... All the better.
E: evil chuckle
N: OFF that terrifying pronouncement, CUT TO...
S: 6 EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – RAMPART – DAY 6
N: ON Zoey, peering intently at the Nightmare Storm. She spots movement in the clouds and then... two Night Terrors burst forth with a SHRIEK! Homing in on the Light Cannon!
C: 83 ZOEY 83
D: Night Terrors headed this way!
N: Zoey hops astride Zian and takes to the skies. Phil leaps up to join her.
C: 84 ZOEY 84
D: I’ll take the ugly one.
E: CONT'D
C: 85 PHIL 85
D: Which one is that? They’re both hideous!
N: Zoey shakes her head and flies off to engage one Night Terror, drawing it away from the rampart. LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 12. Phil heads for the other Night Terror. He SNAPS his tail and fires a light beam but the Night Terror swoops past him, making a beeline for the cannon! Logan spots it.
C: 86 LOGAN 86
D: Oh no you don’t!
N: The Night Terror reaches out its claws for the cannon... Logan POPS into LO-LO and leaps forward to grab the Night Terror by the tail! The Night Terror roars and shakes Lo-Lo off... sends him skidding across the rampart. The Night Terror advances on Lo-Lo, teeth snapping.
C: 87 LO-LO 87
D: WHOOOA!
C: WHIP to Izzie, pissed. 88 IZZIE 88
D: Oh, it’s on.
N: She HURLS her HAMMER at the Night Terror and... WHOMP! It SLAMS into it, knocking the beast off the rampart as the hammer returns to Izzie’s hand of its own accord (think Thor’s hammer in Avengers). Albert and Lo-Lo gape.
C: 89 IZZIE 89
D: Like my new hammer? I dreamcrafted it to act like a boomerang and always come back to me.
E: CONT'D
C: 90 ALBERT/LO-LO 90
D: Criminy. / Sweet!
N: As Albert helps Lo-Lo to his feet, the Night Terror returns
C: with a SHRIEK! 91 ALBERT 91
D: Ready for round two?
N: Lo-Lo grins.
C: 92 LO-LO 92
D: Born ready, chimp.
N: OFF our heroes protecting the cannon, CUT TO...
S: 7 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – CRYSTAL HALL – CONTINUOUS 7
N: Oz, Teo, Coop, and Z Blob manipulate the CRYSTAL TILES into position beneath the SECOND STAINED-GLASS WINDOW. LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 13.
C: 93 COOPER 93
D: How is knowing that the Nightmare King used to be Migo supposed to help us defeat him?
C: 94 MATEO 94
D: I think we have to activate each window to get the whole story.
N: They rotate all the tiles to beam the light streaming from the second window through the Hourglass. And then... WHOOSH! A hologram of Luna and Migo, looking determined, appears. Oz, Mateo, Z Blob and Cooper watch as Luna patiently tries teaching Migo how to dreamcraft. But each time he fails, he gets angrier.
C: 95 MATEO 95
D: She tried to teach him, but his failures just made him mad.
E: CONT'D
N: Luna encourages Migo to keep trying but he SNARLS at her and stalks off. Luna bows her head, despondent.
C: 96 MR. OZ 96
D: What Migo failed to grasp is failure is an important part of the process. Only through practice can one expect to create something new.
N: The hologram changes to reveal the Nightmare King siphoning imagination from a group of unaware dreamers! He uses this dark dream energy to dreamcraft a NIGHTLING!
C: 97 COOPER 97
D: Why learn to dreamcraft when you can just steal kids’ imaginations?!
E: bitter
N: The hologram shifts again. Astride her Pegasus, Luna watches on horrified as the Nightmare King and his Dark Army corrupt an entire realm!
C: 98 MR. OZ 98
D: This must be the moment Luna decided she had to imprison him.
N: As the hologram ends, Coop turns to the others, excited.
C: 99 COOPER 99
D: The third window should tell us how Luna defeated the Nightmare King!
N: LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 14. Mateo hugs Z Blob and whips out the DREAMIE-SCREAMIES (Dream World Walkie-Talkies).
C: 100 MATEO 100
D: How’s it going out there?
T: CUT TO:
S: 8 EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – RAMPART – DAY 8
N: ON Zoey atop Zian, staying one step ahead of a Night Terror. She hears the SQUAWK of her Dreamie-Screamie and picks up.
C: 101 ZOEY 101
D: Kinda busy here, Teo.
N: In the BG, Izzie, Lo-Lo, and Phil are still wrangling with the other Night Terror as Albert guards the cannon.
C: 102 MATEO 102
D: We’re almost done! The last stained- glass window holds the key to defeating the Nightmare King!
C: 103 ZOEY 103
D: Then watch it already. We could use some help!
N: Zoey ends the transmission and tucks the Dreamie-Screamie away. Eyeing the beam of light shooting from the cannon, Zoey gets an idea. She whispers something to Zian, who nods and dives for the beam.
C: 104 ZOEY 104
D: Easy...
E: CONT'D
N: Zian slows down, allowing the Night Terror to gain on them. It’s almost on top of them when...
C: 105 ZOEY 105
D: NOW!
E: CONT'D
N: Zoey agiley flips OVER THE BEAM as Zian FLIES UNDER IT! The Night Terror tries to change course, but can’t! It careens into the light beam and dissolves into DREAM ETHER! Zoey lands back on Zian with a grim smile.
C: 106 ZOEY 106
D: Nice work, Zian.
E: CONT'D
N: ANGLE ON Izzie hurling her hammer at the other Night Terror. The hammer THWICKS through the air. LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 15. But the Night Terror zips out of the way and the hammer accidentally SLAMS into Lo-Lo! Oof! He’s knocked off his feet as Izzie winces.
C: 107 LO-LO 107
D: Ack! Watch it! That thing stings.
C: 108 IZZIE 108
D: Oopsies. Sorry, Lo-Lo!
N: Lo-Lo dizzily stands.
C: 109 LOGAN 109
D: I told you not to call me that!
C: 110 IZZIE 110
D: Whatever you say, Lo-Lo!
E: catching her hammer
N: Just then, BOOSH! The Night Terror swoops in, knocking Izzie’s hammer away! Uh-oh! It advances on Izzie, snarling. Albert and Logan race for her but are too far away... RAAGH! With a roar, Phil shoots a light beam at the Night Terror and SHUNK! The Night Terror turns to crystal!
C: 111 ALBERT 111
D: Nice shot, Phil!
N: Phil flashes Albert a thumbs-up as Izzie holds up her hand a la Thor waiting for his hammer.
C: 112 IZZIE 112
D: This is NOT a drill people.
N: Her hammer WHOOSHES back into Izzie’s hand. She grins and whips it around to SMASH the Night Terror into DREAM ETHER! Logan, Izzie, Albert and Phil WHOOP with delight as Zoey and Zian alight atop the rampart alongside them, victorious. SMASH TO:
S: 9 EXT. SHARKYFACE AIRSHIP - DAY 9
N: The Nightmare King, HOWLING. He angrily FIRES a SHADOW BOLT from his staff, forcing Susan, Snivel and Sneak to dive for cover. The Night Hunter grimaces.
C: 113 NIGHTMARE KING 113
D: I won’t be thwarted by an old man, a monkey, and a couple of children.
N: LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 16.
C: 114 NIGHT HUNTER 114
D: Your Scariness, a small contingent could get around the light cannon. Let me go in and get the little green blob for you.
N: The Nightmare King composes himself. Sneers.
C: 115 NIGHTMARE KING 115
D: No, you’ve had more than enough chances. It’s time I take care of these Dreamchasers myself.
N: The Nightmare King leaps astride his NIGHT MARE, who takes to the skies. As they fly off, he calls over his shoulder: 116 NIGHTMARE KING (CONT'D) 116 Prepare to attack! The Night Hunter slumps, a little crestfallen. Catches Susan, Sneak, and Snivel looking at him and lashes out.
C: 117 NIGHT HUNTER 117
D: You heard him! Man your stations!
N: As the Nightlings jump and scurry into position, CUT TO:
S: 10 EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – RAMPART – DAY 10
N: Our team is in a celebratory mood. But then, Albert catches sight of something zoom out of the stormclouds... he squints.
C: 118 ALBERT 118
D: What’s that?
N: Our team whips around to see... the Nightmare King on his Night Mare! BOOSH! He fires a barrage of SHADOW BOLTS, forcing our heroes to scramble and dive for cover. And then... FATHWOOM! A SHADOW BOLT SMASHES into the light cannon, obliterating it! As debris rains down, the beam of light sputters out and our team stares in horror at... The Sharkyface ship, appearing out of the Nightmare Storm! OFF our heroes facing the approaching onslaught, CUT TO:
S: 11 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – CRYSTAL HALL – CONTINUOUS 11
N: The light from the final hologram flickers over Oz, Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper. LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 17. They watch reverently as Luna materializes at a desk, surrounded by crumpled papers covered in calculations. She looks frazzled and frightened.
C: 119 MATEO 119
D: She’s so scared.
C: 120 MR. OZ 120
D: Trying to figure out how to imprison the Nightmare King took a terrible toll on Luna...
N: In the hologram, Luna picks up a picture of her and Migo in happier times. Sets it aside with a mournful smile. 121 MR. OZ (CONT'D) 121 Deep down, she still felt like he was her dear friend. The hologram changes and we see Luna meet up with three figures, partially hidden by shadows. All three hold
C: HOURGLASSES by their sides. 122 COOPER 122
D: She had help from other Dreamchasers!
C: 123 MATEO 123
D: Maybe that’s how she did it...
N: A loud BOOM within the hologram makes our team jump. Luna and the Dreamchasers looks over their shoulders, fearful.
C: 124 MATEO 124
D: This is it.
E: CONT'D
N: Mateo clutches Z Blob’s hand... the moment of truth... Luna steps alongside the three DREAMCHASERS. As they hold aloft their HOURGLASSES, ready to face down the Nightmare King, reveal... one of the Dreamchasers is Oz!
C: 125 COOPER 125
D: What the--?
N: Mateo, Z Blob, and Cooper look over at Oz, shocked. They are so focused they don’t see... The Nightmare King surreptitiously sneak into the room! He stops in his tracks, shocked by the sight of Luna. Thinking for a second that she’s real, he reaches out his hand... LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 18.
C: 126 NIGHTMARE KING 126
D: Luna...
E: sotto, to self
N: As his hand PASSES THROUGH the hologram, he lets out a frustrated GROWL that draws our team’s attention. Startled, Cooper bumps into one of the crystal tiles, halting the hologram. Mateo stares at the Nightmare King, aghast.
C: 127 MATEO 127
D: How could you, Migo?
C: 128 NIGHTMARE KING 128
D: No one calls me that!
E: with a snarl
N: He whips his staff around... BAWOOSH! He fires a DREAMBOLT at the last stained-glass window, which EXPLODES and shatters against the floor! Before anyone can react, the Nightmare King swings his staff around and knocks Cooper off his feet. Oz fires his TELESCOPE RIFLE but the Nightmare King dodges –- faster than the eye can see. Mateo’s hourglass alights with energy as he dreamcrafts Z Blob into KNIGHT MODE! OFF our heroes locked in battle with the NK, CUT TO:

C: 130 LOGAN 130
D: Teo and Coop better hurry.
C: 131 ALBERT 131
D: You’re right. I don’t know how much more abuse the Castle can stand...
N: Suddenly, FWOOM! The airship’s grappling hook lands on the rampart! Nightlings stream across! LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 19. Izzie uses her hammer to THWACK incoming Nightlings. Logan POPS into Lo-Lo, rolls himself into a ball, and BARRELS through a group. BOOM! On the ship, the Night Hunter has Albert dead to rights, crossbow aimed...
C: 132 NIGHT HUNTER 132
D: I’ve got you now, you insufferable monkey.
N: FFWIIP! Zoey clocks the crossbow bolt streaking towards him... no escape... she yanks Zian around... WINDS HER CLOCK... THUD! The Night Hunter stares in confusion at the crossbow bolt stuck in the side of the castle and Albert cradled unharmed in Zian’s paws! Off Albert’s relief, CUT TO:
S: 13 INT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – CRYSTAL HALL – DAY 13
N: Sir Z keeps blocking the Nightmare King’s SHADOWBOLTS, but is obviously tiring. Mateo and Cooper dreamcraft ARROWS. FFWIIP! FFWIIP! The Nightmare King has no trouble FLICKING them away! ANGLE ON Oz. He’s got a bead on the NK. Fires his rifle... CLICK! He’s all out of ammunition!
C: 133 MR. OZ 133
D: I’m out!
N: Seeing that Oz is momentarily distracted, the Nightmare King spins his staff around... WHACK! Oz falls to the floor, knocked out! ON Cooper, noticing his sand is running low.
C: 134 COOPER 134

C: 135 NIGHTMARE KING 135
D: As if two children would be a match for me.

C: 136 MATEO 136
D: Leave him alone!
N: The Nightmare King CACKLES and SHOOTS out a swirl of PURPLE AND BLACK DREAM ETHER that snakes around Cooper and Mateo, immobilizing them! They grunt, trying to break free. LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 20. The Nightmare King BLASTS Sir Z again and again... leaving plain ol’ regular sized Z Blob, woozy and shaky.
C: 137 MATEO 137
D: Migo, please...
E: CONT'D
N: The NK approaches Mateo, reaches out, menacingly...
C: 138 NIGHTMARE KING 138
D: Oh, I stopped being Migo a long time ago... The day I figured out how to make Luna remember me.
E: beat, then
C: 139 MATEO 139
D: By corrupting the Dream World!
N: The Nightmare King preens, evil yet undeniably charismatic.
C: 140 NIGHTMARE KING 140
D: Everyone says they want good dreams. Yet when they wake up, they’ve forgotten them. But give someone a nightmare...
E: eerie smile
C: And they’ll NEVER FORGET! 141 COOPER 141
D: You’re a monster!
E: aghast
C: 142 NIGHTMARE KING 142
D: What can I say? Darkness is more powerful than light... And I LOVE power.
C: 143 MATEO 143
D: Whatever it takes, we’re going to stop you and protect the Dream World!
C: 144 NIGHTMARE KING 144
D: Oh, Mateo. Who said anything about the Dream World?
E: with a smug chuckle
N: To Mateo’s horror, the Nightmare King scoops Z Blob up and heads for the door!
C: 145 MATEO 145
D: Z! NOOOOOOOOOOO!
N: LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 21. Z’s eyes widen as he’s whisked out of the Castle! Desperate, Mateo fights free of the inky, black dream ether restraining him and yanks Cooper free. They rush to Oz’s side...
C: 146 COOPER 146
D: I’ve got him! GO!!
N: As Mateo races away, Coop helps a woozy Oz to his feet. He throws Oz’s arm over his shoulder.
C: 147 COOPER 147
D: Mr. Oz, you were there! Why don’t you know how Luna defeated the Nightmare King?
E: CONT'D
C: 148 MR. OZ 148
D: We don’t have time for this, Cooper! We need to get Luna’s Hourglass and get out of here!
N: They turn towards the Hourglass but then... BOOM! A section of wall SHATTERS, sending crystal shards raining down! Coop yanks Oz out of harm’s way but the Hourglass is buried in the rubble.
C: 149 COOPER 149
D: Leave it! We have to go!
N: They stumble for the door as we CUT TO:

C: 150 MATEO 150
D: Z! HOLD ON!
N: Mateo closes the distance between him and the Nightmare King until... an ungodly BOOOOOM! Dust and debris fill the air, as parts of the castle fly in every direction! The force throws Mateo off his feet... As the dust settles, he scrambles up to see the Nightmare King leap astride his Night Mare and take to the skies. Mateo whips out his hourglass – he has the tiniest amount of sand left – but then...
C: 151 LOGAN 151
D: Help!
E: O.S.
N: LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 22. Teo whips his head around... spots Logan dangling dangerously from a part of the rampart! He won’t be able to hold on much longer! Mateo whips his head from Z Blob to Logan and back -– faced with an impossible choice.
S: 15 EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – RAMPART – SAME 15
N: ON Logan scrabbling for purchase on the CRYSTAL SHARD... fingers slipping... he SCREAMS as he loses his grip and falls... THUD! To his surprise, he lands unharmed on something hard. ON Zoey, astride Zian. As she watches in awe, the crystal shards COME TOGETHER and form a STAIRCASE leading down! ON Izzie as she rushes to lean over the rampart’s edge... her mouth falls open... she’s stunned to see...
C: 152 IZZIE 152
D: Holy guacamole! How is this possible?
N: Zoey swoops by and points.
C: 153 ZOEY 153
D: It’s your brother! Look!

N: The Nightmare King gazes at Teo, appraisingly.
C: 156 NIGHTMARE KING 156
D: That one is stronger than I thought...
N: As the Sharkyface ship zips away, DISSOLVE TO: LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 23.
S: 17 EXT. CASTLE NOCTURNIA – GARDEN – SAME 17
N: Our team slumps sadly around the garden. Beaten and defeated. The Dreamlings huddle around Phil, who sheds big tears. Mateo sits apart, staring into space, despondent. Our team exchange a worried look –- unsure how to approach him. Izzie slowly stands and walks over to her brother. Her heart breaking at the grief etched on his face.
C: 157 IZZIE 157
D: I’m so sorry, Mateo.
C: 158 MATEO 158
D: I just want him back...
N: Izzie wraps her arms around her distraught brother.
C: 159 IZZIE 159
D: He knows you love him.
C: 160 MATEO 160 I left him! 161 IZZIE 161
D: You didn’t have a choice. You saved Logan. Z Blob’s strong. He knows we’re coming for him.
N: Hearing that, the rest of the team clusters around Mateo.
C: 162 LOGAN 162
D: We’ll help you get Z Blob back.
C: 163 ZOEY 163
D: And we won’t rest until we do.
C: 164 MATEO 164
D: Yeah? How are we gonna do that? We have no idea how to defeat the Nightmare King.
C: 165 COOPER 165
D: Not yet we don’t.
N: Cooper plunks down a SHARD OF STAINED-GLASS WINDOW.
C: 166 MR. OZ 166
D: Is that a piece of the stained- glass window?
E: startled
N: LEGO 09/28/21 "Assault on Castle Nocturnia" 24.
C: 167 COOPER 167
D: Yep. I found it in the ruins of the Crystal Hall. Figure it could come in handy... if we can find the other pieces.
C: 168 IZZIE 168
D: We can. We will.
C: 169 ALBERT 169
D: That’d be one heck of a puzzle.
C: 170 MATEO 170
D: Forget it! There’s too many pieces. We’ll never figure it out!
N: Cooper cocks his head, remembering what Teo said to him earlier.
C: 171 COOPER 171
D: Yanno, as someone wise said to me not long ago... Nothing’s impossible. As long as we do it together.
N: Mateo glances up sharply, recognizing his own words. He sees his friends nodding, solemnly. Heartened by the resolve in their eyes, Mateo slowly rises to his feet.
C: 172 MATEO 172
D: Right then. I guess we got some work to do.
N: Off our heroes’ determined faces, we...
T: FADE TO BLACK...
